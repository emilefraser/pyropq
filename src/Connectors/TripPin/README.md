# TripPin Tutorial
This multi-part tutorial covers the creation of a new data source extension for Power Query. The tutorial is meant to be done sequentially – each lesson builds on the connector created in previous lessons, incrementally adding new capabilities to your connector. 

This tutorial uses a public [OData](http://www.odata.org/documentation/) service ([TripPin](http://services.odata.org/v4/TripPinService/)) as a reference source. Although this lesson requires the use of the M engine’s OData functions, subsequent lessons will use [Web.Contents](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt260892.aspx), making it applicable to (most) REST APIs.

## Prerequisites

The following applications will be used throughout this tutorial:

* [Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45331), May 2017 release or later
* [Power Query SDK for Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/powerquerysdk)
* [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) - Optional, but recommended for viewing and debugging requests to your REST service

Reviewing the [M Extensibility documentation](../../docs/m-extensions.md) before starting this tutorial is highly recommended.
