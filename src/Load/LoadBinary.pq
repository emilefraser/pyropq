/*
Parameters
----------
FolderName -> Folder path for traversing.
Data Path -> Default folder path for traversing
File Name -> Full or Partial Name of the file to locate.
Recursive -> Default value is false. True will force the folder to be traversed recursively (all sub directories).
tblColumnMapping -> Mapping for Rename operations. Consists of three stages.
Extension -> List to filter into required file extensions.
Filter -> Filters the Folder Contents using a function which operates on table. This is post stage 1 rename and sorting. By default, recent file will be selected
Buffer -> Enables buffer before opening the file contents. By default, the file contents will not be buffered
